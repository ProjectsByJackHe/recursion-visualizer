# This project is no longer being maintained!

As Server hosting fees started racking up due to many many infinite recurisive loops being submitted to what is more or less a hackathon project, 
I decided it was better to just pull the plug. Sorry :(

# Recursion Visualizer 

Ever wondered what the recursive structure of your Leetcode algorithm looks like? 
Then you are in luck! This project allows you to see recursion in your code. 
Whoa! What does that mean? Basically, write a single recursive function, and this app will show you step by step how your algorithm reached it's solution. And at each stage of the recursion, you're able to navigate the call graph and see the return output value at each stage. How does that sound? 

## Build it locally
Ok, so what you need is Node.js v12.18.3, Python 3.8.5, and a lot of patience. Wait, no, I meant you need Flask. So, just install everything in requirements.txt in the remoteCodeRunner, run npm install in the react-frontend directory, start the Flask server, and you should be good! (also, you need to adjust your localhost flask URL inside the react directory.)
